  #The name of .yaml files are not important, you can name it whatever you like, the important
  #thing is the name of the main key in .yaml file which is "framework" in this case.
  #this framework key is the same as the one in config/packages/framework.yaml
  #using two or more times the same key in different .yaml files won't
  #override the previous one, it will merge them together.

  # php bin/console cache:clear
  # php bin/console cache:pool:clear cache.app


  # Unique name of your app: used to compute stable namespaces for cache keys.
  #prefix_seed: your_vendor_name/app_name

  # The "app" cache stores to the filesystem by default.
  # The data in this cache should persist between deploys.
  # Other options include:

  # Redis
  #app: cache.adapter.redis
  #default_redis_provider: redis://localhost

  # APCu (not recommended with heavy random-write workloads as memory fragmentation can cause perf issues)
  #app: cache.adapter.apcu

  # Namespaced pools use the above "app" backend by default
  #pools:
  #my.dedicated.cache: null
